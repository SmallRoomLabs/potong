## POTONG6

This is just a small utility board that I added to a previous batch of PCBs. Nothing fancy at all. :-)

Sometimes I need a pot or two when I test a design on a solderless breadboard and it's always a PITA to fit the pots into the breadboard, same thing with switches. So I made the POTONG6 that is a SOB DP8049-sized breakout board with six small (10x10mm) potentiometers and six small slide switches for easy connection to a breadboard. 

As can be seen in the picture there's a lot of jumpers on the board. Each pot can have its terminals jumpered to vcc & gnd and only have the wiper connected to the breadboard (good when you only want a variable voltage), or all three terminals can be accessed individually.

Same thing with the switches. Either connected to vcc/gnd via resistors and you only connect the common to the breadboard or remove the jumpers and have access to all three terminals.
